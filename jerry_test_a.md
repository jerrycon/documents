20240323 - Briefly back.
20171219 - Still not really getting this whole thing. Learned more about it today, but quite a long ways to go. I do like the way GitHub shows history of all changes. I see it work with markdown docs. Not yet understanding where/how it fails on MS Office docs.

20171130 - Just making changes for purposes of looking at them in history. Noticed today that it's easy to see what changed from previous version to current version, but haven't seen way to compare changes from multiple previous versions ago to current version.

20171128 – Let’s upload this to jerrycon/documents on github to see what happens
to the previously existing, identically named document.

It seems to have created a new version 1.0. Have not yet found record of my
changes to the body text.

Now that we're in a markdown file, editing becomes available. This line should show up as an addition.

Now I want to do a deletion, but I need something to delete. Here we go...
